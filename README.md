 ### Some of my recent projects üìÇ:
 * [NFT Club](https://github.com/KitanGarcia/NFT-Club) - Won first place in the inaugural MLH-Solana Hackathon, when I was just learning Solana. Created NFTs using Candy Machine and Treat Toolbox, along with a frontend allowing users to mint them.
 * [NAS NFT Project](https://github.com/KitanGarcia/NFT-Project) - Wrapping up a silly NFT project of mine allowing users to connect their wallets, mint NFTs, and stake and unstake them to gain reward tokens. Featuring my terrible drawings.
 * [Solana Core](https://github.com/KitanGarcia/Buildspace-solana-core) - Finishing up the most comprehensive Solana program to date. Includes projects in vanilla Rust, Anchor, and React based around Solana development, creating NFTs, security, testing, and client-side development in Web3.
 * __SolEd__ - Presented in the Solana Vancouver Hacker House. A work-in-progress educational platform with the goal of empowering experts to create instructional materials and, in turn, earn SOL or USDC from learners enrolled in their courses. Functioning on the backend as an on-chain off-chain hybrid.
